# MyCourses App

MyCourses is an application that allows a user (student) to search the CS courses catalogue (similar to SIS API) and organize courses into three categories:

* Taken: a course user has already taken (in the past)
* Enrolled: a course user is currently taking (in the present)
* Interested: a course user would like to take later (in the future)

This repository contains the frontend. To run locally:

* Clone this repository
* Install dependencies by `npm install`
* Run in development mode by `npm run start`
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You must connect the frontend to the backend here [https://courses-api-hw4.herokuapp.com/](https://courses-api-hw4.herokuapp.com/).

You must deploy the frontend and put a link to the deployed at here: [https://courses-website-homework.netlify.app](https://courses-website-homework.netlify.app).
